            <h1>Kyle Maloney</h1>
            <p style="font-family: 'Courier New', Courier, monospace; color:brown">Software Engineer</p>
            <p>I am a student in my junior year at Iowa State University.
                This semester I am taking 5 classes with 16 credits including
                Com s 311, 317, and 319 as well as English 309 and Math 267.

            <div class="container">
                <h2>Projects</h2>
                <div class="project">
                    <img src="./images/project1.png" alt="Project 1">
                    <h3>Project 1</h3>
                    <p>
                        The first project is related to develop a single Web page using
                        only two technologies: HTML and CSS. The project consists in
                        creating a single web page with a menu at the top know as
                        Navigation Bar. We have to include text describing ourself and
                        text describing the project. Additionally, we need to include
                        two images: one image is of ourself and second image is anything
                        related to the project itself.
                    </p>

                    <h3>Project 2</h3>
                    <p>
                        The second project is one I made in a group last semester
                        for the class com s 309. My group and I made an app using
                        springboot for the backend and android studio for the frontend
                        that functioned as a place to play different games. Our
                        biggest accomplishments were the additions of games such as
                        texas hold 'em' and whack-a-mole.
